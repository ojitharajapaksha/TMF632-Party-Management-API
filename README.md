## Frontend Integration

### Update Your Frontend Service
Your Dashboard is already configured to work with these APIs. Update your `agreementService` to use the new endpoints:

```javascript
// src/services/agreementService.ts
const API_BASE = 'http://localhost:3000';

export const agreementService = {
  // TMF651 Agreement Management
  getAllAgreements: () => 
    fetch(`${API_BASE}/tmf-api/agreementManagement/v4/agreement`),
  
  createAgreement: (agreement) =>
    fetch(`${API_BASE}/tmf-api/agreementManagement/v4/agreement`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify(agreement)
    }),
  
  deleteAgreement: (id) =>
    fetch(`${API_BASE}/tmf-api/agreementManagement/v4/agreement/${id}`, {
      method: 'DELETE'
    }),

  // Consent Management
  getConsentOverview: () =>
    fetch(`${API_BASE}/api/consent/overview`),
  
  getAuditTrail: () =>
    fetch(`${API_BASE}/tmf-api/eventManagement/v4/event`),
  
  exportAuditTrail: () =>
    fetch(`${API_BASE}/tmf-api/eventManagement/v4/event/export/csv`)
};
```

## Production Considerations

### Security
- [ ] Implement JWT authentication
- [ ] Add API rate limiting  
- [ ] Enable HTTPS
- [ ] Implement field-level encryption for sensitive data

### Monitoring
- [ ] Add logging (Winston/Morgan)
- [ ] Health check endpoints
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Error tracking (Sentry)

### Compliance
- [ ] Data encryption at rest
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Automated compliance checks
- [ ] Data retention policies

## Support

For issues and questions:
1. Check the API health endpoint: `GET /health`
2. Review the logs in `logs/` directory
3. Verify environment configuration in `.env`
4. Test individual endpoints with curl or Postman

Your Consent Management System backend is now ready to support your frontend Dashboard with full TM Forum API compliance and PDPA regulatory adherence!
